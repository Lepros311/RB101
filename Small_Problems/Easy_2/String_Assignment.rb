# name = 'Bob'
# save_name = name
# name.upcase!
# puts name, save_name

# What does this print out? Can you explain these results?

# BOB
# Bob

# The first puts is all caps because .upcase! is called on it. The second is not all caps because name was not upcased yet when it was assigned to save_name

# WRONG, DUMBASS.
