# Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path. How are they different?

# From LS solution:

# Both methods can be found on the documentation page for the File class in the Core API section. File::path is a class method, while File#path is an instance method.

# Class methods are called on the class, while instance methods are called on objects.
